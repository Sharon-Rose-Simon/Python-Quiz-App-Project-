# Python-Quiz-App-Project-
This is my python project which demonstrates my skills in building a console-based Quiz application. It showcases my understanding of programming concepts such as user input, conditionals, loops, and basic control flow.  

# What I learned: 
- How to handle user input and validate responses
- Using conditional statements for coding programs
- I learnt to structure a simple console-based application
- Debugging and testing Python code to ensure correctness

# Skills Used: 
- Python Programming
- User Input handling
- Control Flow (e.g. Conditionals, loops)
- Problem-solving and Logical thinking

# Tools Used: 
- Pycharm Community Edition = This is for writing and testing the code
- Git and GitHub = This was for Version Control Management
